/*
 * reims-vgpu: shim services that do not depend on which bus attached the
 * device, shared by reims-vgpu-pci and reims-vgpu-mmio.
 *
 * A service belongs here when its body reads nothing from the device state:
 * either it ignores the HostOps `ctx` entirely (host clock, address-space
 * queries, vCPU-relative reads) or it needs only the console, which the
 * caller passes explicitly. Anything that touches the bus object, the
 * per-device dirty tracker, or a bus-specific trace event stays in its shim.
 *
 * The point is not line count. A duplicated button table or address-space
 * predicate is a table that can drift, and a drift between the two shims is
 * a bug the guest sees on exactly one pathway.
